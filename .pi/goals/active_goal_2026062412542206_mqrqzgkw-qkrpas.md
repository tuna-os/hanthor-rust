# Goal Prompt

Set up GitHub CI that runs `cargo test --workspace` and `flatpak-builder` builds on every push, producing a green checkmark that proves all 106+ tests pass across all three apps (Letters, Tables, Decks) and suite-common. Currently tests exist but cannot run locally — CI must provide the GTK4/libadwaita runtime environment.

Success criteria:
- A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on push/PR to main
- `cargo test --workspace` passes with all 18+ existing tests green
- `cargo clippy --workspace` passes with zero new warnings
- At least one Flatpak manifest builds successfully via flatpak-builder
- Test coverage expanded: suite-common gets 15+ tests, Tables gets 12+, Decks gets 8+, Letters gets 6+ (currently: suite-common 7, Tables 7, Letters 3, Decks 1)
- CI badge in README.md shows green
- No regression: all features implemented in the post-v1.0 session (sort, borders, freeze, merge, formatting, validation, charts, undo, transitions, drag, notes, images) have at least one test exercising them

Boundaries:
- In scope: CI workflow, additional tests, flatpak build verification, README badge
- Out of scope: GUI automation tests (Dogtail/AT-SPI), performance benchmarks, cross-platform testing, code coverage metrics

Constraints:
- CI must run without a self-hosted runner (use containers)
- Must work on GitHub's ubuntu-latest or container-based runner
- Flatpak build uses org.gnome.Platform 50 SDK from Flathub
- Do not modify existing test assertions — tests that already pass must keep passing


Ordered steps:
1. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with container-based GTK4 environment
2. Run `cargo test --workspace` on the CI container — fix any test failures
3. Run `cargo clippy --workspace` — fix all warnings
4. Add `flatpak-builder` build step — verify at least one manifest builds
5. Expand test coverage: write tests for suite-common (undo, format, events — target 15+ tests)
6. Expand test coverage: write tests for Tables (sort, borders, freeze, merge, validation — target 12+ tests)
7. Expand test coverage: write tests for Decks (undo, transitions, drag — target 8+ tests)
8. Add CI status badge to README.md
9. Push and verify CI runs green on GitHub

If blocked: If a container-based approach can't provide GTK4 libs for linking, pivot to Flatpak SDK approach (`flatpak-builder --run` inside CI). Stop and ask user before switching strategy.

## Progress

- Status: sisyphus running
- Auto-continue: on
- Sisyphus mode: yes (prompt/criteria style)
- Time spent: 17m44s
- Tokens used: 680K (679,588) tokens
- Verification contract: CI workflow run shows all green. `cargo test --workspace` output shows 40+ tests passing. README badge links to passing workflow.
